        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
            Plato, born around 428/427 BCE in Athens, Greece, was a philosopher and student of Socrates. He founded the
            Academy, an
            influential school of thought, around 387 BCE. Plato's dialogues, written in the form of conversations,
            explore various

            philosophical ideas, including ethics, politics, and metaphysics. His most notable works include "The
            Republic,"
            outlining his vision of an ideal state, and "The Symposium," discussing love and beauty. Plato's enduring
            impact on
            Western

            philosophy lies in his profound contributions to epistemology, ethics, and political theory. He died circa
            348/347 BCE.
